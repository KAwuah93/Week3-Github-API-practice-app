# Week3 Weekend Github:

### Description:
  - The assignment for this week was to create a program that makes API calls to github to retrieve information about our accounts. There was also very light manipulation of threads to get the job done, in order to execute the tsak async and then update the view after the task was done.
### Tech used
- I used a Gson converter to change Json strings into actual objects. I ran into an issue with the size of the string in the later parts of the assignment and had to adjust the way i read the objects onto the program. 
- Also used Picasso to attach images to Image views with their URLs.
